I've played though bobs mods about 2.5 times and I have some personal tips about how to go about it for Arumba. A lot of it is subjective preference so it's certainly not the "correct" way to play. I haven't gone through all the way with the extra science packs so that may differ. 1. A main bus doesn't need much of the bobs mods stuff on it. At most I find Copper, iron, steel, tin, coal, and one of each of the circuits to fit most my needs so long as the bus is the ideal solution. –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ—è–∑—ã—á–Ω—ã–π —Å–∞–π—Ç –ø–æ –∏–≥—Ä–µ Factorio. –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –≥–∞–π–¥—ã, –º–æ–¥—ã, —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∏–≥—Ä—É. Hey /r/factorio, it's Gangsir. I've just released a massive update to one of my old mods, Supply Drop. What's Supply Drop? It's a mod that adds in Rimworld-esque periodic supply drops that contain resources, machines, and other small niceties. Originally, the mod was released way back in 0.14, but it was super simplistic and a bit overpowered, as it was able to give you items you hadn't obtained/researched yet, as well as way too many items. I've almost completely rewritten Ever felt like building a factory ? Factorio is a 2D creative game about mining resources, using robotic arms to move stuff, transporting things on transport belts, automating production with assembling machines, researching technologies, exploring. ___ What is this? ___ The idea behind the monthly community map is to share a map exchange string at the beginning of every month, and get as many people as we can to start a new world with it. Then at the end of the month (or even periodically if you'd prefer!) we share screenshots and saves of our factories so that we can see how different people approach the same spawn; how they set up their base, how they deal with aliens, and how they arrange their science, power, and everything else.
