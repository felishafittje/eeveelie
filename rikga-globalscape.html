Has anyone had any issues connecting to an external FTP over TLS server with the Palo Alto classifying the traffic as enhanced-file-transfer? We export data to several clients usually over FTP. The firewall has handled those just fine but one client upgraded to a new FTP platform (Globalscape) and it's the first I've seen classified with that App-ID. The connection is established via FileZilla and all is well until it initializes TLS then it just times out. I don't see anything being blocked. My company is looking for a secure file exchange service that is GDPR compliant - I was hoping that /r/sysadmin might have individuals who can provide recommendations.

https://www.globalscape.com/ - Summary: gtGlobalSCAPE, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, develops and distributes software, delivers cloud-based solutions, and provides associated services for secure information exchange. We're looking at Globalscape EFT with the DMZ Gateway. Everything looks fine for what we're needing, but I noticed that the DMZ Gateway bundles Java components. As it doesn't appear to be updated all that often, this concerns me from a security perspective. Anyone using these products care to comment both on the general level of satisfaction and the Java concerns? Thanks. All, For the past several months we've been having major issues with a program called mail express. Mail Express is essentially a program we use to transfer files too large for emails. Files can be up to 2gb each, and up to 10gb can be sent at once. We use this for transferring all manner of things from CAD drawings to renderings to huge files of output data. We transfer internally as well as outside-in and inside-out. It is a web interface. We had been running an out of date version It appears that Globalscape's SFTP server is not particularly standards compliant, neither paramiko nor pysftp seem to interact correctly with the server (it requires a key AND a password). Has anyone come across this before and come up with a solution. So I've inherited multiple EFT servers in my new shop. It's the usual horror story - nothing quite matches, no one is sure how or why it works the way it does, what settings are necessary, etc. I started digging into the COM API ( to see if I could build some sort of toolkit for managing these servers. I'm making somewhat slow progress and I've been trying to put my google-fu to work. Does anyone have experience. Hello, My company needs to provide a way for clients to upload large amounts of data files to our servers. The catch is that most of our clients cannot install a third-party application on their workstations to do this. We have tested WebDAV but found that Windows 7 has a bug with mounting these shares as drives without thirdparty clients, so that's out. Does anyone know of any browser-based ways to accomplish this? Thanks. 
We're looking at deploying a trial of Globalscape WAFS to solve (or mitigate) an issue with opening files across our WAN. Just wondering if anyone has used it, and if so - is it good? How is support? Does the software work reliably? Are new releases buggy? etc. Thanks. So here's the story. I just graduated in Dec., have two degress and been applying to jobs left and right. I got a call last Thursday from a man who said the company (Amer Solutions) saw my resume on Monster.com and was wanted to know if I was interested in a job as a technical writer about 2 hours away from where I currently live. I said sure, whatever - it's another job opportunity, right? He sends me the job description, we agree on a salary and I confirm via e-mail, etc. A couple of hours. Файловые архивы.
